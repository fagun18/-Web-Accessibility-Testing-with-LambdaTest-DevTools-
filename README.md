🤔 What is Accessibility Testing?
Accessibility testing is a method used to check websites to ensure that content is accessible without relying on traditional ways of interaction (e.g., using a mouse, touchpad, reading content, etc.). It ensures that websites and apps can be used easily by everyone, including people with disabilities like vision or hearing problems, and other physical or cognitive issues.

Accessibility testing simplifies WCAG & ADA compliance through comprehensive scanning, including Full Page, Multi-Page, Partial Page, and Workflow scans. It improves accessibility by ensuring compatibility with screen readers, providing an automation SDK, and implementing regular monitoring schedules.



📢 Why Accessibility Testing?
Cater to the Market for Disabled People

According to a global economics report, the estimated population of persons with impairments represents a market larger than China, controlling over $13 trillion. Ensuring apps are accessible can help organizations tap into this vast market.

Abide by Accessibility Legislation

Governments globally have laws mandating IT products be accessible to persons with disabilities. The W3C has created guidelines to ensure:

- Perceivable: Information must be understandable to all users (e.g., alternate text for images).

- Operable: Navigation must be accessible (e.g., keyboard, gesture, or voice navigation).

- Understandable: Content should be readable and understandable.

- Robust: Content must be robust across different devices and technologies.

Social Responsibility

88% of Americans with disabilities have access to the internet and digital devices. Organizations must ensure their web and mobile apps are accessible to support this group.

Business Benefit

Removing barriers to access can increase customer base and improve reputation.

User-Centered Design

Designing accessible products leads to a better user experience for all.



🔧 Types of Accessibility Testing
Functional Testing

Evaluate functionality with assistive technologies, such as screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.

Usability Testing

Ensure products are easily understandable and usable, often involving feedback from people with disabilities.

Compatibility Testing

Check compatibility with various devices, browsers, and assistive technologies.

Performance Testing

Evaluate performance to ensure versatile usage, such as load time and responsiveness.



📋 How to Create an Accessibility Testing Test Plan?
1. Define the Accessibility Goals

   - Align goals with business objectives and user needs (e.g., increase user base, comply with legal standards).

2. Identify the Accessibility Requirements

   - Follow specific standards and guidelines (e.g., WCAG).

3. Choose the Accessibility Methods

   - Select techniques and tools (e.g., manual reviews, automation tools).

4. Plan the Accessibility Test Activities

   - Define test scenarios, select participants, prepare materials, and document results.



🛠 How to Perform Accessibility Testing?
1. Review Accessibility Standards and Guidelines

2. Prepare the Test Environment

   - Set up tools and technologies.
